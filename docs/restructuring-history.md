# Code-Reasoning Directory Streamlining Plan

After carefully analyzing the structure and content of the `~/Sites/code-reasoning/` directory, this document outlines a comprehensive plan to streamline the files and directory structure. This plan will improve organization while maintaining all essential functionality.

## Directory Structure Changes

1. **Create Better Organization:**
   - Create a new `docs/` directory to consolidate documentation
   - Keep `public/` (used by the visualizer to store generated files)
   - Keep `dist/` but ensure it's in `.gitignore` (contains compiled code)

## Documentation Restructuring

1. **Reorganize Documentation Files:**
   - Move detailed content from README.md into dedicated files in the docs/ directory
   - Create a more concise README.md with essential information only
   - Move EXAMPLES.md â†’ docs/examples.md
   - Move CONFIGURATION.md â†’ docs/configuration.md
   - Move TEST.md â†’ docs/testing.md
   - Move DEBUGGING_PLAN.md â†’ docs/development-history.md (or remove if not needed)
   - Keep CLAUDE.md at the root but make it more concise

2. **Content Consolidation:**
   - The current README.md is very long (8,000+ words) and can be simplified
   - Reduce duplication between documentation files
   - Create a clearer separation between user docs and developer docs

## Code Structure

1. **Keep Existing Source Code Structure:**
   - No changes needed to the code structure as it's already well-organized
   - The source files in `src/` have clear separation of concerns:
     - `server.ts`: Main server implementation
     - `logger.ts`: Logging functionality
     - `logging-transport.ts`: Transport layer for logging
     - `visualizer.ts`: Dashboard visualization

2. **Test Directory:**
   - The test directory structure is appropriate with the test-client.ts file

## Configuration Files

1. **No Changes Needed:**
   - `package.json`, `tsconfig.json`, and other configuration files are appropriate
   - `.gitignore` may need updating to ensure `dist/` is excluded

## Progress Tracking

This section tracks the implementation progress of each task in the plan.

## Validation and Testing Protocol

After each phase of implementation, the following validation steps should be performed:

1. **Verify File Integrity:**
   - Ensure all files were moved/copied correctly
   - Check that no content was lost in the process

2. **Test Build Process:**
   ```bash
   cd ~/Sites/code-reasoning/
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Test Functionality:**
   - Run the server locally
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   - Verify visualizer loads correctly in browser
   - Execute test client
   ```bash
   cd test
   ts-node test-client.ts
   ```

4. **Check Documentation Integrity:**
   - Ensure all links between documentation files work
   - Verify README.md points to correct locations in docs/

5. **Scan for Hardcoded References:**
   - Search for any hardcoded paths that might need updating
   ```bash
   cd ~/Sites/code-reasoning/
   grep -r "README.md" --include="*.ts" .
   grep -r "CONFIGURATION.md" --include="*.ts" .
   grep -r "EXAMPLES.md" --include="*.ts" .
   grep -r "TEST.md" --include="*.ts" .
   grep -r "DEBUGGING_PLAN.md" --include="*.ts" .
   ```
   - Update any found references to point to the new locations

## Rollback Procedures

If issues arise during implementation, follow these rollback procedures using version control:

- If changes have not been committed:
  ```bash
  git checkout -- <file>  # Discard changes to specific file
  # OR
  git checkout -- .       # Discard all changes
  ```

- If changes have been committed but need to be reversed:
  ```bash
  git revert HEAD         # Create a new commit that undoes the last commit
  # OR
  git reset --hard HEAD~1 # Roll back to the previous commit (use with caution)
  ```

- If on a feature branch that needs to be abandoned:
  ```bash
  git checkout main       # Switch back to main branch
  git branch -D <branch>  # Delete the problematic branch
  ```

## Implementation Approach

This streamlining plan will be implemented in phases, with progress tracked in the tables above. Version control will be handled manually after confirming each phase's changes.

1. **First Phase - Documentation Directory Setup**
   - Create the docs/ directory
   - Set up initial structure

2. **Second Phase - Documentation Restructuring**
   - Move documentation files to docs/ directory
   - Update references between files
   - Create new concise README.md
   - Validate all links work

3. **Third Phase - Directory Cleanup**
   - Remove unnecessary directories (if any)
   - Update .gitignore for dist/

4. **Fourth Phase - Final Validation**
   - Perform full testing protocol
   - Document any issues in progress tracking tables

After each phase, update the progress tracking tables in this document.

## Success Metrics

The streamlining will be considered successful when:

1. **Organization Improvements:**
   - All documentation is properly organized in the docs/ directory
   - README.md is concise (<1000 words) and points to detailed docs
   - Unnecessary directories and files are removed

2. **Functionality Preservation:**
   - All code builds without errors
   - Server runs correctly
   - Visualizer displays properly
   - Test client runs successfully

3. **Documentation Quality:**
   - No broken links or references
   - Clear separation between user and developer documentation
   - Reduced duplication between documentation files

## Cross-Session Communication

Since this plan will be implemented across multiple AI chat sessions, each session should:

1. **Start by checking progress:**
   - Review the Progress Tracking tables to understand what has been completed
   - Read the notes from previous sessions

2. **Update the plan during/after implementation:**
   - Mark tasks as "In Progress" when starting them
   - Mark tasks as "Completed" when finished
   - Add the date and AI session identifier to the relevant fields
   - Add any important notes about challenges or decisions made
