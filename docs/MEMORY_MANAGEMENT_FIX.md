# Memory Management Fix Analysis

## Critical Memory Leak Investigation (July 30, 2025)

### Executive Summary

The MCP server process (PID 71334) experienced a catastrophic native code memory leak, growing from normal operation (~128MB) to **11GB of memory usage** before being terminated to prevent system crash. This was **not** a JavaScript heap leak but a native code memory leak in C++ modules.

### Evidence Collected

#### Memory Usage Statistics
- **Process RSS**: 11,105,388 kB (11GB)
- **Virtual Memory**: 12,223,264 kB 
- **Memory Regions**: 49,227 writable regions (normal: ~hundreds)
- **JavaScript Heap**: Normal (~8MB, responded to GC)
- **Native Memory**: Rapidly expanding outside V8 control

#### System Call Analysis (5-second sample)
```
% time     seconds  usecs/call     calls    errors syscall
------ ----------- ----------- --------- --------- ----------------
 50.16    0.159451          55      2856           munmap
 47.17    0.149944           2     63368     19360 futex
  1.37    0.004342           3      1442           mprotect
  1.03    0.003259           2      1442           mmap
```

**Key Observations:**
- **1,442 mmap calls** vs **2,856 munmap calls** in 5 seconds
- **19,360 futex errors** indicating severe thread contention
- **Memory fragmentation**: Allocations in 64MB+ chunks not being coalesced
- **Allocation pattern**: Continuous mmap/munmap cycle suggesting buffer reallocation

#### Memory Region Analysis
- Largest single regions: 391MB, 174MB, 116MB chunks
- Pattern of 64MB allocations across multiple regions
- Memory scattered across virtual address space (fragmentation)

### Root Cause Analysis

#### Primary Issue: Native Code Memory Leak
The leak occurred in **native C++ modules**, not JavaScript:

1. **PostgreSQL Driver Buffers**
   - Connection pool maintaining large result buffers
   - Query result sets not being properly released
   - Native libpq memory not freed after operations

2. **Cognitive Processing Native Allocations**
   - Large context objects being allocated in native code
   - Circular buffer implementations using native memory
   - Timer callbacks holding references to native allocations

3. **Thread Synchronization Issues**
   - 19,360 futex errors indicate deadlock/contention
   - Multiple threads competing for memory allocation
   - Cleanup threads unable to free memory due to locks

#### Contributing Factors
- **Timer Accumulation**: Health check intervals creating callback references
- **Connection Pool Sizing**: Up to 20 PostgreSQL connections with 30s timeout
- **Context Size**: Large cognitive context objects (1MB+ JSON)
- **Session History**: Unbounded session map growth

### Failed Mitigation Attempts
Standard JavaScript memory management techniques were ineffective because the leak was in native code:
- **Garbage Collection**: `global.gc()` showed normal heap usage
- **Circular Buffers**: JavaScript-level buffers worked correctly
- **Timer Cleanup**: TimerManager was functioning properly
- **Session Cleanup**: LRU cleanup was operating as designed

### Immediate Prevention Measures

#### 1. Process Memory Monitoring
```bash
# Add to startup script - auto-kill if RSS > 1GB
watch -n 30 'ps -o pid,rss,cmd -p $(pgrep -f sentient-agi) | awk "NR>1 && \$2>1000000 {system(\"kill \"\$1); print \"Process killed due to memory leak: \" \$2 \"KB\"}"'
```

#### 2. PostgreSQL Connection Limits
```typescript
// Reduce connection pool size immediately
this.pool = new Pool({
  ...this.config,
  max: 3,        // Reduce from 20 to 3
  min: 1,        // Reduce from 2 to 1
  idleTimeoutMillis: 5000,   // Reduce from 30s to 5s
  connectionTimeoutMillis: 3000,
  allowExitOnIdle: true
});
```

#### 3. Native Memory Circuit Breaker
```typescript
// Add to cognitive-orchestrator.ts
private checkNativeMemoryPressure(): boolean {
  const memUsage = process.memoryUsage();
  const rssInMB = memUsage.rss / 1024 / 1024;
  
  if (rssInMB > 500) { // 500MB limit
    console.error(`üö® Native memory pressure: ${rssInMB}MB - initiating emergency cleanup`);
    this.emergencyCleanup();
    return true;
  }
  return false;
}
```

#### 4. Forced Process Restart
```typescript
// Add automatic restart every 1000 thoughts
if (this.cognitiveState.thought_count % 1000 === 0) {
  console.log('üîÑ Preventive restart at 1000 thoughts to prevent memory leaks');
  process.exit(0); // Let process manager restart
}
```

### Long-term Solutions

#### 1. Native Module Audit
- **Profile PostgreSQL driver**: Use valgrind to identify buffer leaks
- **Audit dependencies**: Check all native addons for memory management
- **Replace problematic modules**: Consider pure-JS alternatives

#### 2. Memory-Safe Architecture
- **Stateless design**: Minimize long-lived native objects
- **Streaming operations**: Avoid large buffer accumulation
- **Resource pooling**: Explicit cleanup of native resources

#### 3. Enhanced Monitoring
```typescript
// Native memory monitoring
setInterval(() => {
  const usage = process.memoryUsage();
  const rssGrowth = usage.rss - this.lastRSS;
  
  if (rssGrowth > 50 * 1024 * 1024) { // 50MB growth
    console.warn(`üîç Rapid native memory growth: +${rssGrowth/1024/1024}MB`);
    this.investigateMemoryGrowth();
  }
  
  this.lastRSS = usage.rss;
}, 30000);
```

#### 4. Resource Lifecycle Management
```typescript
// Explicit cleanup interface
interface NativeResourceManager {
  cleanup(): Promise<void>;
  getMemoryUsage(): number;
  forceCleanup(): Promise<void>;
}
```

### Testing and Validation

#### Memory Leak Detection
```bash
# Run with memory profiling
node --expose-gc --trace-gc --trace-gc-verbose --max-old-space-size=512 server.js

# Monitor native memory growth
while true; do 
  ps -o pid,rss,vsz -p $(pgrep -f sentient-agi) | tail -1
  sleep 10
done
```

#### Stress Testing
```typescript
// Simulate high-load scenarios
for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
  await processThought(generateLargeThought());
  if (i % 100 === 0) {
    const usage = process.memoryUsage();
    console.log(`Iteration ${i}: RSS=${usage.rss/1024/1024}MB`);
  }
}
```

### Critical Action Items

1. **IMMEDIATE**: Implement process memory monitoring and auto-kill
2. **DAY 1**: Reduce PostgreSQL connection pool to 3 connections max
3. **WEEK 1**: Add native memory pressure detection and emergency cleanup
4. **MONTH 1**: Audit all native dependencies for memory leaks
5. **ONGOING**: Monitor for RSS growth patterns and investigate spikes

### Lessons Learned

1. **JavaScript profiling insufficient** for native memory leaks
2. **System-level monitoring essential** for production Node.js apps
3. **Connection pools are dangerous** without strict limits
4. **Native code debugging requires different tools** (valgrind, strace, pmap)
5. **Preventive restarts** may be necessary for long-running processes

This memory leak was a **native code issue** that standard JavaScript memory management could not address. The solution requires system-level monitoring, resource limits, and preventive measures rather than code-level optimizations.
