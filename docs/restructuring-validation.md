# Directory Structure Validation Report

## Changes Implemented

This document records the changes made to the directory structure as part of the streamlining plan.

### Directory Structure Changes

| Change | Status | Date | Notes |
|--------|--------|------|-------|
| Create docs/ directory | ✅ Completed | 2025-04-24 | Directory created to consolidate documentation |
| Keep public/ directory | ✅ Verified | 2025-04-24 | Existing directory preserved (used by visualizer) |
| Keep dist/ directory | ✅ Verified | 2025-04-24 | Existing directory preserved (contains compiled code) |
| Verify dist/ in .gitignore | ✅ Verified | 2025-04-24 | Confirmed dist/ is properly excluded |

### Validation Steps Performed

1. **Directory Structure Verification**
   - Confirmed docs/ directory was successfully created
   - Confirmed public/ directory still exists
   - Confirmed dist/ directory still exists
   - Confirmed dist/ is properly excluded in .gitignore

### Next Steps

The directory structure changes have been successfully implemented and verified. The next steps in the streamlining plan are:

1. **Documentation Restructuring**
   - Move EXAMPLES.md → docs/examples.md
   - Move CONFIGURATION.md → docs/configuration.md
   - Move TEST.md → docs/testing.md
   - Move DEBUGGING_PLAN.md → docs/development-history.md
   - Create a more concise README.md

2. **Validation of Documentation Changes**
   - Verify all links between documentation files work
   - Check that README.md points to correct locations in docs/
   - Scan for any hardcoded references that might need updating

This validation report was created during the implementation of the streamlining plan on April 24, 2025.
