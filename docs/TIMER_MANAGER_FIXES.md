# TimerManager Runaway Process Fixes

## Problem Analysis
The 24GB memory consumption and 77% CPU usage was caused by **unbounded timer loops** in the consciousness simulator that had no automatic termination conditions.

## Root Cause
1. **TimerManager lacked lifecycle controls** - timers ran indefinitely once started
2. **Consciousness simulator timers had no exit conditions** - only stopped on manual `destroy()` 
3. **No stream completion detection** - timers didn't know when thought processing was complete
4. **No memory pressure awareness** - timers continued even under extreme memory pressure

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced TimerManager with Lifecycle Controls
**File**: `src/utils/timer-manager.ts`

**New Features Added**:
- ✅ **TTL (Time-to-Live)**: Automatic timer cleanup after specified duration
- ✅ **Execution Count Limits**: Stop timers after N executions
- ✅ **Memory Pressure Monitoring**: Terminate timers when memory usage exceeds threshold
- ✅ **Stream Completion Detection**: Manual marking of completed thought streams
- ✅ **Runtime Updates**: Modify timer lifecycle parameters on-the-fly

**New Timer Interface**:
```typescript
timerManager.setInterval(callback, delay, name, {
  maxExecutions: 1000,        // Stop after 1000 executions
  ttlMs: 5 * 60 * 1000,      // Stop after 5 minutes
  memoryPressureLimit: 0.8,   // Stop at 80% memory usage
});
```

### 2. Smart Consciousness Timer Management
**File**: `src/cognitive/consciousness-simulator.ts`

**Applied Limits**:
- **Consciousness Loop**: Max 1000 executions, 5-minute TTL, 80% memory limit
- **Stream Generation**: Max 500 executions, 3-minute TTL, 75% memory limit  
- **Adaptive Scaling**: Max 200 executions, 10-minute TTL, 85% memory limit

**Stream Completion Detection**:
- Monitors consciousness state for low activity + stability
- Emergency completion when memory objects exceed 5000
- Automatic timer cleanup when streams are complete

### 3. Memory Pressure Integration
**Real-time Monitoring**:
```typescript
private getCurrentMemoryPressure(): number {
  const memUsage = process.memoryUsage();
  return memUsage.heapUsed / memUsage.heapTotal;
}
```

## Default Safety Limits

| Timer Type | Max Executions | TTL | Memory Limit |
|------------|---------------|-----|--------------|
| Consciousness | 1000 | 5 min | 80% |
| Stream Generation | 500 | 3 min | 75% |
| Adaptive Scaling | 200 | 10 min | 85% |

## Termination Reasons Tracked
- `max executions reached (N/limit)`
- `TTL expired (Ns/limits)` 
- `memory pressure limit (X% > Y%)`
- `stream completed`

## Prevention Mechanisms

### Automatic Cleanup Triggers
1. **Time-based**: Timers auto-terminate after TTL expires
2. **Count-based**: Timers stop after reaching execution limits
3. **Memory-based**: Timers stop when memory pressure is too high
4. **State-based**: Timers stop when consciousness reaches stable low-activity state
5. **Emergency**: Immediate termination when memory objects exceed thresholds

### Monitoring & Debugging
- Enhanced timer status logging with termination reasons
- Memory pressure tracking integrated into timer lifecycle
- Debug mode shows all timer lifecycle events

## Expected Impact

**Before**: 
- Timers ran indefinitely
- 24GB+ memory consumption
- 77% sustained CPU usage
- No automatic cleanup

**After**:
- Timers auto-terminate based on multiple conditions
- Memory usage bounded by pressure limits
- CPU usage reduced through execution limits
- Intelligent stream completion detection

## Usage Examples

```typescript
// Basic timer with lifecycle controls
const timerId = timerManager.setInterval(callback, 1000, 'my-timer', {
  maxExecutions: 100,
  ttlMs: 60000,
  memoryPressureLimit: 0.7
});

// Mark stream as completed to trigger cleanup
timerManager.markStreamCompleted(timerId);

// Update lifecycle parameters at runtime
timerManager.updateTimerLifecycle(timerId, {
  maxExecutions: 50,
  ttlMs: 30000
});
```

## Configuration Options
The consciousness simulator now respects these performance config options:
- `maxConsciousnessExecutions` 
- `consciousnessMaxRuntimeMs`
- `consciousnessMemoryLimit`
- `maxStreamExecutions`
- `streamMaxRuntimeMs` 
- `streamMemoryLimit`
- `maxAdaptiveExecutions`
- `adaptiveMaxRuntimeMs`
- `adaptiveMemoryLimit`

**This completely resolves the runaway process issue by ensuring timers have multiple built-in termination conditions that prevent infinite loops and unbounded resource consumption.**
