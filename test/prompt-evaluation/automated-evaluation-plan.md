# Automated Prompt Evaluation System

## Implementation Status: Complete ✅

The automated evaluation system has been fully implemented and is now the exclusive method for prompt evaluation. The implementation:

- **Objective Metrics**: Programmatically calculates metrics based on thought chain structure and parameter usage
- **Subjective Evaluation**: Uses Claude via the Anthropic API to evaluate thought quality against criteria
- **Fully Automated**: Operates without human intervention, eliminating the evaluation bottleneck
- **Batch Processing**: Supports parallel evaluation of multiple scenarios for efficiency

The previous manual evaluation system has been removed as it is no longer needed.

## Overview

The automated evaluation system eliminates the human bottleneck in prompt evaluation, allowing Claude to evaluate thought chains without human intervention. The system combines objective metrics calculated programmatically with subjective evaluation performed by Claude via the Anthropic API.

## Workflow

The evaluation process follows this automated workflow:

```
Test Scenario → Claude API (generation) → Extract Thought Chain →
                                                ├→ Objective Metrics Analysis
                                                └→ Claude API (evaluation)
                                                      ↓
                                                Combined Results → Automated Report
```

This workflow provides consistent, scalable evaluation of prompt effectiveness. The system can process many more scenarios and variations with higher consistency than was previously possible with manual evaluation.

## Key Features

The automated evaluation system includes:

1. **Objective Metrics Analysis**

   - Parameter validation and structure analysis
   - Branch and revision detection
   - Completion status determination
   - Parameter usage scoring

2. **Claude-Based Subjective Evaluation**

   - Scenario-specific criteria evaluation
   - Detailed justifications for scores
   - Overall assessment and comments

3. **Fully Automated Workflow**

   - No human intervention required
   - Consistent evaluation criteria
   - Reproducible results

4. **Batch Processing**
   - Parallel evaluation of multiple scenarios
   - Configurable concurrency settings
   - Progress tracking and reporting

## Usage

To use the automated evaluation system:

1. Run the API evaluator: `npm run eval:api`
2. Select a Claude model for evaluation
3. Choose scenarios to evaluate
4. Configure batch processing settings (if evaluating multiple scenarios)
5. Set retry attempts and fallback options
6. Specify prompt variation name
7. Let the system run automatically

The system will:

- Send scenarios to Claude for generation
- Extract thought chains
- Calculate objective metrics
- Send to Claude for evaluation
- Save comprehensive results
- Generate comparison reports (optional)

## Future Directions

Potential enhancements to the automated evaluation system:

1. **Evaluation Quality Metrics**

   - Add metrics to evaluate the quality of automated evaluations
   - Compare automated versus human evaluations for calibration
   - Adjust weights and algorithms based on calibration results

2. **Advanced Batch Processing**

   - Implement smarter rate limiting and queuing
   - Add failure recovery and automatic retries
   - Support interruption and resumption of batch jobs

3. **Visualization Improvements**

   - Add graphical representation of thought chains
   - Create interactive comparison dashboards
   - Generate trend analysis across prompt variations

4. **Integration with CI/CD**
   - Run automated evaluations as part of CI/CD pipelines
   - Set quality thresholds for automated approval/rejection
   - Track prompting effectiveness over time
